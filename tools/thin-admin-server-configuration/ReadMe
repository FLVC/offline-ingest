The admin webservers are written in ruby, the software is called
thin. These servers listen only on localhost ports. Each institution
has its own thin server, so we must run the servers on different
ports.  We use apache to proxy to those servers. These instructions
describe the first-time setup, and the scripts provided help automate
the process of setting up the local thin servers and ports, externally
addressed virtual hosts via apache, and the mappings between them.


Step 1: Install and configure thin. This is a lightweight web server
written in ruby.

   ✓ # gem install thin
   ✓ # cp admin-thin-servers /etc/init.d/
   ✓ # chkconfig --add admin-thin-servers
   ✓ # mkdir /var/run/thin
   ✓ # chown apache:apache /var/run/thin

Step 2: Create and install the configuration files.

   # cd /usr/local/islandora/offline-ingest/tools/thin-admin-server-configuration

   if necessary, edit the file create-configs and specify the
   directory we want to write the files to:

             DESTINATION_DIRECTORY="/opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.d"

   run the script

   # ./create-all

Step 3: Start her up.

   # service admin-thin-servers start

   visit an admin web site, this is a good one to try:

       http://fsu.admin.digital.flvc.org/

   # chkconfig admin-thin-servers on
