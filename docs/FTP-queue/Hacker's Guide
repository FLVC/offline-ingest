* Notes on how the ftp queueing system hangs together internally, for programmers


** The 'god' process manager starts (and aurtomaticaly restarts) the ftp-handler and ingest-handler ruby scripts

   The 'god' start-up scripts are in /etc/init.d/god and
   /etc/god.conf.  Oddly, it's the latter where the code-action
   happens.

** ingest-handler is a ruby script that's started as a separate process to ingest packages

*** ingest-handler is started with one or more command line arguments from the set [ ftp, digitool ]

   The initial idea is to have one ingest-handler process digitool and
   ftp queues, in that order, and a second ingest-handler process only
   the ftp queue.


** ftp-handler is a ruby script that's started as a separate

*** ftp-handler uses the config.yml file to determine the roots of the incoming directories.
