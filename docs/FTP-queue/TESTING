1)  Get some prosepctive packages suitable for FAU in a local directory


2) Set up filezilla with these parameters in the site manager:

Host   		 islandload-test.flvc.org
Protocol	 FTP
Encryption	 Require explicit FTP over TLS
User		 ftpdlfarf
Password	 ********

Connect, and change the local directory to the one set up in 1) above



3) Get a window on islandload-tst.flvc.org; cd to /var/log/ and run

    tail -f messages | grep -v FIREWALL

to see the logs as ingest progresses


4) Change the remote directory to /incoming and upload a package; view
   log activity (it will take ten seconds or so to pick up the
   directory)

5) test behaviors - you'll want to check admin.fau-test.digital.flvc.org
   as you go...

   When the system detects a package in incoming, a new container
   directory is created in /processing, of the form /processing/aaaa/
   - the uploaded package is copied to it.

   N.B. Filezilla will display what it thinks are in the remote
   directories.  You'll have to refresh the directory explicitly
   (there's an icon with two horizontal arrows on it that does this).

   Properly ingested packages should be deleted; well-formed packages
   with errors are placed in /errors; those with warnings are placed
   in /warnings.  This is so the affiliate can check, retrieve and
   correct problems.

   You should not be able to modify anything in /processing; there
   should be no junk left in /processing once the system has dispensed
   processing ot.

   You should be able to retreive and delete materials in /errors and
   /warnings at your whim. (delete appears to be temporarily
   unavailable)

6) Break it.

   What happens when the ingest process fails crashes?  Find some
   really egregious examples that Lydia's reported for the package
   program, and modify them so they are prospective-ready.  Try these.
