FTP instructions for prospective ingest.

There are four directories under your FTP home with the following
names and purposes:

 * incoming/

   The directory to place your packages. Only one level of directories
   is permissible here, which should be the package name.

 * processing/

   This directory contains packages undergoing ingest - you should
   never modify the contents of this directory.  Youâ€™ll notice that
   each package has been moved under a uniquely-named container
   directory such as 'aaaa', 'aaab', etc.

 * errors/

   This directory contains processed packages that generated errors;
   these are in the container directories created for processing
   above. You may retrieve these packages to examine and correct them,
   if necessary.

   To avoid filling up the FTP filesystems, please remove these
   packages (including their container directories) in a timely
   manner. They may be removed after a certain period automatically by
   the system.

 * warnings/

   This directory contains processed packages were ingested and posted
   to your web site, but generated warnings during processing.  See the
   guidelines for the errors directories above. This directory may be
   deprecated in the future.
