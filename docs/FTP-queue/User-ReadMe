FTP instructions for prospective ingest.

There are four directories under your FTP home with the following
names and purposes:

 * incoming: the directory to place your packages. Only one level of
   directories is permissible here, which should be the package name.

 * processing: packages awaiting processing - you should never modify
   the contents of this directory.  Youâ€™ll notice that packages have
   been moved to  unique container directories of the form 'aaaa',
   'aaab', etc.

 * errors: processed packages that generated errors;  these are in
   the container directories created for processing above. You
   may retrieve these packages to examine and correct them, if
   necessary.

   To avoid filling up the FTP filesystems, please remove these
   packages (including their container directories) in a timely
   manner. They may be removed after a certain period automatically
   by the system.

 * warnings: processed packages that generated warnings.  See the
   guidelines for the errors directories above.
